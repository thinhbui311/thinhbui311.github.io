            When Yakuza 4 released it decided to add a fresh mechanic to the game, where instead of having Kiryu as the sole main protagonist, he instead shared the limelight with three other characters â€” Shun Akiyama, Taiga Saejima, and Masayoshi Tanimura.
            While it was great to have a variety of characters and more story content, many players just wanted to get back to playing as their favorite, Kiryu, and this meme perfectly conveys that. That's not to say that the other characters don't have their own fan following, but Kiryu is of course the most popular choice.
