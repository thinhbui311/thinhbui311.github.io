        <p>Kiryu has a best friend. His name is Nishiki</p>
        <div>
            Anyone who has played the original Yakuza game or the Kiwami remake will know the context of this meme and why it's funny. Poor innocent Kiryu takes the blame for a murder his best friend and side character Nishiki committed, and when he is released ten years later he can't wait to see his old buddy.

Unfortunately, Nishiki isn't the same guy as before and actually serves as one of the antagonists of the game. That's one way to stop being best friends with someone...
