            Kiryu has a code which is never hurt innocent people

            Kiryu appears to suffer from the same affliction as Batman does; they both claim to not be willing to kill people, but most of the time when they're taking down bad guys, you just know that those people aren't surviving the beatings.

The idea that your opponents are going to survive the attack is even less likely when Kiryu uses lethal weapons such as Katanas, guns, swords, and more. The Kiryu in cutscenes is a far cry from the Kiryu beating people in the street, and this meme conveys the difference between the two.
