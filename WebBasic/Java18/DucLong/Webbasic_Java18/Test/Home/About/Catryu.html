            The world recently found something new to create memes of after a lawyer accidentally joined a zoom call with a cat filter on and didn't know how to remove it, forcing him to state "I am not a cat".

        <div>
            This meme takes that idea but makes it a Tojo clan meeting and has Kiryu as the person using the filter. As previously mentioned, Kiryu is not the best with technology so it's totally spot-on that it would be him to make this mistake. It's also adorable that he has misspelled "dragon" for his zoom name.
