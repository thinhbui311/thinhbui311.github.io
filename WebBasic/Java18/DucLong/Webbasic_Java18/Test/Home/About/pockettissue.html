            While the Dragon of Dojima might only need his fists (and legs) as his primary weapons, the Yakuza games do actually let you equip weapons for some added damage. The downside to this is that the police, or Majima pretending to be an officer, might check you for weapons in the first game.

            One item you get plenty of in the game without even trying is pocket tissues, NPCs literally hand them out for free, so you'll soon have your pockets full of them.
