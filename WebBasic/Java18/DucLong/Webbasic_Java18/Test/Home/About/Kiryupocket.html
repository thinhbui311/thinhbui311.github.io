            Well it's a game so there's no need for logical explain for why Kiryu can put billions of key inside his pocket right

            One of the collectibles in more than one of the Yakuza games is locker keys, which are scattered all around the city of Kamurocho. Collecting the keys allows you to open the lockers to score various loot and goodies.

Of course, it does mean that Kiryu is just randomly carrying around a lot of keys, which this meme rather hilariously points out. Just imagine having to sort through all those to find the one you actually want to use.
