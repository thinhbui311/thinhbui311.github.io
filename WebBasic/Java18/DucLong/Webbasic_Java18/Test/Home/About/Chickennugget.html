            Yes, there is a chicken in Yakuza and its name is Nugget. While that might seem a bit cruel, it is really a test to see whether Nugget has what it takes to be a yakuza. Like Kiryu, Nugget has to work his way up from the bottom, and its name serves as a constant reminder that the world is not a forgiving place.

            Considering Nugget can be assigned to manage real estate in Yakuza 0, this is evidently one chicken that is not happy to simply serve as someone's meal.
